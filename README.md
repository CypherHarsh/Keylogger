### **Python Keylogger with Telegram Integration**  

#### **Overview**  
This script is a simple yet powerful keylogger that logs keystrokes and sends them to a Telegram bot in batches of 20 keystrokes. It is developed for **ethical hacking, cybersecurity research, and educational purposes**.  

#### **How It Works**  
- Captures all keyboard inputs using the `pynput` library.  
- Stores the keystrokes in a local file (`keylog.txt`).  
- Sends the collected keystrokes to a **Telegram bot** after every **20 key presses**.  
- Stops execution when the **Escape (ESC)** key is pressed.  

#### **Features**  
âœ… Logs all keystrokes, including special keys.  
âœ… Sends logs to Telegram in real time but in controlled batches.  
âœ… Clears the log file after sending to Telegram to avoid duplication.  
âœ… Runs silently in the background without user interference.  

#### **Installation & Setup**  
**Requirements:**  
- Python 3.x  
- Required libraries: `pynput` and `requests`  

To install dependencies, run:  
```bash
pip install pynput requests
```

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Replace `"your_bot_token"` and `"your_chat_id"` with your actual **Telegram bot** credentials.  
2. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```
3. Press **ESC** to stop logging at any time.  

#### **Use Cases**  
- Ethical hacking & penetration testing.  
- Monitoring keystrokes for security research.  
- Analyzing user behavior (with consent).  

#### **Important Disclaimer**  
ðŸš¨ **This script is for educational and ethical research purposes only.** Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and can result in severe legal consequences. **Always obtain permission before deploying this script on any system.**
